###Write a Python program that runs repeatedly and prompts the user to enter a number â€“ it should stop when the user enters a sentinel value. Once all numbers are entered, the program should print the following information using one of the methods provided by Python:
###1. The number of numbers entered in the list
###2. The smallest value in the list
###3. The largest value in the list
###The program should use iteration, a list, and user-defined functions.
